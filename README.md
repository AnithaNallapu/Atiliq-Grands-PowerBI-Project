Microsoft Power BI: Revenue Optimisation in the Hospitality Sector
Project Overview
This project focuses on leveraging data analytics to enhance revenue optimisation for AtliQ Grands, a luxury hotel chain operating across India. Facing challenges in maintaining market share and revenue in the competitive luxury/business hotel segment, AtliQ Grands sought to integrate data-driven decision-making to regain their position in the industry.
